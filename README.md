# Email-Class-C-
An Email class created in c++

1) Download the eamailget.exe from the repository
2) After installation, copy the EAGetMailobj.tlh and EAGetMailobj.tli from the repository into the "Project X" of your folder inside C:\User\Repos
3) Now download the given "stadfx.h" from the repository into the same directiory inside Repos. Or you can alternatively enable and run your own pre-compiled header from the Visual Project
4) You can now run the "Email class" and modify it as follows. The class populates a text file of your given requirement in a single function of all emails inside your inbox. This currently supports headings and body. But will be modified and committed for further use. Thanks

Requirements Update:
1) The wstring ** pointer to store the subject and body, can be modified to have a loop with 5-@@ (infinity) preceding columns to each row in the loop initiator.
   These 5-6 columns can consecutively store, the bcc, the cc, the date, the subject, the body, the replies, the attachments etc. Thus the pointer has been created keeping this in    mind.
